MVC (Model–View–Controller)

Model: Represents data and business logic. In this experiment the Model layer uses Mongoose schemas to map to MongoDB collections (products, categories, users, reviews).

View: UI templates (e.g., EJS, Pug, Handlebars, or a frontend framework) that render data to users.

Controller: Receives HTTP requests, interacts with Models, and returns Views or JSON responses.

MongoDB

NoSQL document database storing JSON-like documents (BSON).

Flexible schema approach ideal for product catalogs where different products may have different attributes.

Use Mongoose (ODM) for schema definitions, validation, and easy query APIs in Node.js.

REST principles

Use standard HTTP verbs: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (delete).

Endpoints should be resource-oriented: /products, /products/:id, /categories, etc.
