Description:

This project is a web-based SVG Drawing Tool that enables users to draw freehand lines directly inside a browser window. It is implemented using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

Structure (HTML)

The main layout contains a drawing container with a title, an SVG canvas, and a hint message.

The <svg> element (id="drawArea") with dimensions 800×400 acts as the drawing surface where users can sketch with the mouse.

A guiding note is provided to inform users how to draw: “Click and drag inside the box to draw lines. Release mouse to finish a line. Draw again to start a new line.”

Styling (CSS)

The drawing container is styled with borders, padding, and a white background for clarity.

The SVG area has a light background and a solid border to make it stand out.

Lines drawn on the SVG are styled with a blue stroke (#0a74c9), 2px thickness, and no fill.

A hint message is styled with a smaller font and a subtle color for readability.

Functionality (JavaScript)

Initialization: The script waits for the DOM to load and then references the SVG element.

Mouse Down:

Starts the drawing process.

Records the first mouse position inside the SVG.

Creates a new <path> element and moves to the starting point (M x y).

Mouse Move:

Tracks mouse movement while drawing is active.

Continuously appends line segments (L x y) to the <path> to follow the cursor.

Mouse Up / Mouse Leave:

Ends the drawing process.

Resets state variables so that a new line can start when the user clicks again.

Key Concept

The drawing is achieved by dynamically updating the d attribute of an SVG <path> element, which defines the sequence of points that make up the line.

Each time the mouse moves, the path grows with new coordinates, creating the effect of freehand drawing.

Overall, this project demonstrates how to combine SVG graphics, DOM manipulation, and mouse events to implement a lightweight drawing application in the browser.
