1. Introduction
A Command-Line Interface (CLI) Employee Management System is a text-based program that allows users to manage employee records interactively through the terminal. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUI), a CLI relies on textual menus, prompts, and user inputs to perform operations such as adding, listing, and removing employees.

2. Purpose of the UI
The purpose of the CLI UI in this system is to:

Provide an easy-to-use interactive menu for employee management.

Enable users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a step-by-step structured flow.

Maintain simplicity for beginners while demonstrating real-world menu-driven applications in Node.js.

3. Structure of the CLI UI
Main Menu

Displays the title: “Employee Management System”.

Provides four numbered options:

Add Employee

List Employees

Remove Employee

Exit

User Input & Navigation

The program prompts the user: “Enter your choice:”.

Based on input (1–4), the corresponding function is executed.

Add Employee

UI asks for employee details:

“Enter employee name:”

“Enter employee ID:”

Shows confirmation message upon successful addition.

List Employees

Displays all employees in a numbered list with their name and ID.

Example:

yaml
Copy code
Employee List:
1. Name: Alice, ID: E101
2. Name: Bob, ID: E102
Remove Employee

UI prompts: “Enter employee ID to remove:”.

Shows success or error message depending on whether the ID exists.

Exit

Displays a farewell message:
“Exiting Employee Management System. Goodbye!”

Ends the CLI session.

4. Characteristics of CLI UI in this System
Text-based: Works entirely within the terminal without graphics.

Menu-driven: Provides a clear numbered menu for navigation.

Interactive: Responds to user input in real-time.

Error Handling: Validates input and shows error messages for invalid entries.

Sequential Flow: Guides the user step by step for each operation.

5. Advantages of CLI UI
Simple and lightweight – no additional UI libraries required.

Easy to implement and understand for beginners.

Faster execution compared to GUIs.

Can be run on any system with Node.js installed.

6. Limitations
Not visually appealing compared to GUI applications.

Requires memorizing commands or navigating through menus manually.

Limited scalability for complex systems.
