Description:

This project is a simple SVG-based drawing tool that allows a user to draw freehand lines inside a browser using mouse interactions. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the <svg> element acts as the drawing canvas.

Working

The webpage displays a titled drawing area (SVG Drawing Tool) with an 800Ã—400 SVG canvas.

When the user clicks and drags the mouse inside the canvas, a new <path> element is created, and the line is continuously updated with each mouse movement.

The path is constructed by recording mouse coordinates and joining them with line segments (L) in SVG.

Releasing the mouse (or moving it outside the SVG) ends the current line, and the user can start a new one.

Styling

The drawing area and container are styled with borders, padding, and background colors for a clean look.

Lines are styled with a blue stroke (#0a74c9), 2px thickness, and no fill.

A hint message guides the user on how to draw lines.

Script Logic

Initialization: Waits for the DOM to load and selects the SVG element.

Mouse Down: Starts a new path and stores the first point.

Mouse Move: Adds new points to the array and updates the <path> d attribute dynamically.

Mouse Up / Leave: Ends the drawing process and resets variables.

Overall, this tool demonstrates how SVG paths, event listeners, and mouse position tracking can be combined to implement a lightweight freehand drawing feature in the browser.
